# Hyperparameter Optimization With Genetic Algorithms in Kotlin

![image](images/image.jpg)

[Hyperparameter optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization)
is all about selecting the best 
hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, activation functions etc. 
for neural networks. 

On the other hands, 
[Genetic Algorithms ( GEs )](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-optimization-with-genetic-algorithm-2f5001d9964b) 
are Evolutionary
Algorithms which work on the principle given by Charles 
Darwin, "Only the fittest individual survives". A population 
would contain a specific number of individuals ( NNs ), and the 
fittest one ( the one with the smallest loss ) will be evolved!

We have our project **Coding Feed-forward Neural Networks in Kotlin**
( [GitHub](https://github.com/shubham0204/Feedforward_Neural_Network_Kotlin) , [Medium](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/coding-feed-foward-neural-networks-in-kotlin-or-android-b93efd47538f) )
and extending it further, we add GE based hyperparameter 
optimization to it, all in your favourite Kotlin.
